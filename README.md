# Humor Text Classification
This is a notebook that contains an example of how to build a humorous text classifier using the Python language and the TensorFlow library.

## Data
The dataset contains only two columns, "text" and "mood", where text is all the text and mood is a boolean column with True to have humor in the sentence and False to have no humor.
The dataset used in this analysis was taken from Kaggle, an online data science platform that offers public and private datasets, as well as tools for data analysis and modeling.

## Data pre-processing
The first step in building the classifier is to pre-process the data. This involves cleaning up the texts and extracting relevant features from the texts.

## Classification Model
For the classification model, TensorFlow was used, which is used for machine learning and artificial intelligence that allows building, training and deploying complex models efficiently.

## Results
The obtained results indicated that the classification model had a good performance in the identification of humorous texts. The accuracy of the model was approximately 90%.
